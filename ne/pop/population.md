# Population Wrapper

Bridge/adapter layer between network objects and eval/optim layers providing tracking attributes for continual learning.

Provides algorithm-agnostic wrapper adapting networks for different optimizers: GA operates on network objects via select_networks(indices), ES operates on parameter vectors via get/set_parameters_flat(). Tracking attributes for continual learning: curr_episode_score/num_steps [num_nets] (for env_transfer), curr_eval_score/num_steps [num_nets] (current evaluation/generation), total_num_steps [num_nets] (across all evaluations), continual_fitness [num_nets] (accumulated across generations), saved_env/saved_env_out (environment state for env_transfer), logged_score (differs by transfer mode), curr_gen (generation number). Adapter methods use protocol-based dispatch: select_networks() for GA (StructuralNetwork calls select_and_duplicate(), ParameterizableNetwork calls clone_network()), get/set_parameters_flat() for ES/CMA-ES (ParameterizableNetwork only). Wraps any network type (BatchedFeedforward, BatchedRecurrent, DynamicNetPopulation). Key principle: Population is adapter, optimizers don't know network structure. Used by ne/eval/*.py to create populations and by ne/optim/*.py for selection/mutation.

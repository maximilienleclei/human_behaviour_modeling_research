# Dynamic Network Batched Computation Test

Test code demonstrating batched GPU-parallel forward computation for dynamic networks with varying topologies.

Contains WelfordRunningStandardizer class for online z-score standardization using Welford's algorithm (incremental mean/variance without storing all samples). State tensor n_mean_m2_x_z tracks: n (sample count), mean (running mean), m2 (sum of squared deviations for variance), x (previous raw value), z (previous z-score). Algorithm: 1) Update mask for new values, 2) Welford update (n+=1, delta=x-mean, mean+=delta/n, m2+=delta*(x-mean)), 3) Z-score (x-mean)/sqrt(m2/n) for n≥2, 4) Pass-through old z-scores and zeros, 5) State storage. Function barebone_run() provides example implementation showing batched forward pass construction with index mappings for variable-structure networks, weight concatenation, and multi-pass execution mask for recurrence. Demonstrates efficient GPU parallel evaluation across population with different topologies. Core pattern used by main.py's DynamicNetPopulation for batched computation infrastructure.

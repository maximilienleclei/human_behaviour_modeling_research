# Dynamic Network Population Wrapper

Production wrapper for dynamic network populations with batched GPU-parallel computation (GA-exclusive, not differentiable).

Contains DynamicNetPopulation managing evolving-topology networks. Creates pop_size networks via evolution.Net, applies one mutation each, builds batched computation infrastructure. _build_computation_infrastructure() constructs tensors for GPU-parallel forward passes (pattern from compute_test.py): n_mean_m2_x_z (Welford standardization state, 0-padded at front), wrs (WelfordRunningStandardizer), index mappings (input_nodes_start_indices, input_nodes_indices, output_nodes_indices, mutable_nodes_indices, flat_in_nodes_indices), weights (concatenated connection weights), num_network_passes_per_input_mask (boolean mask for multi-pass execution with variable recurrence depth). Methods: forward_batch() for parallel population evaluation, mutate() applying topology mutations to each network then rebuilding infrastructure, select_and_duplicate() for GA selection with network cloning. Implements StructuralNetwork protocol from protocol.py. get_state_dict()/load_state_dict() for checkpointing. Used by dl/models/dynamic.py as platform-compatible interface.

You have a tendency to write my name as maximilian instead of maximilien in certain commands, which messes up your file reading, beware!

In plan mode, make sure to dump your plan to a file in the repositor in case we run out of context/usage. You can delete it once the plan has been implemented. Also write down progress checks so that we know what you already did and what is left to do.
